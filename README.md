ClickMe Game

Welcome to ClickMe, a fun and engaging game built using Python and the Pygame module.

Gameplay:

In ClickMe, your objective is to click on as many rings as possible before they disappear. Rings will randomly appear on the screen, grow to their maximum size, and then shrink until they vanish. To click a ring, simply use your mouse to click on it.

Navbar:

The game features a navigation bar that provides you with important information during gameplay:
Time Speed: This shows the current speed of the game. The faster the speed, the more challenging the game becomes.
Rings Clicked: This displays the number of rings you've successfully clicked.
Lives Remaining: You start with 5 lives. Each time you miss clicking a ring before it disappears, you'll lose a life.

Closing the Game:

You can end the game at any time by clicking the close icon in the top-right corner of the game window. Additionally, if your lives reach zero, the game will automatically end, and you'll be able to see your final score.
